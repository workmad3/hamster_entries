Hamster Entries
===============

Redevelopment of online entry system for hamster shows.

Original development was a rails 1.2.3 application that is now very
outdated and suffered from bitrot. Redevelopment is intended to
provide a much more solid application, along with expanding the
original app to handle shows from multiple clubs, more easily handle
multiple administrators and clean up the user system.

Additionally, the booking in of welfare and rehoming hamsters would
be desirable.
